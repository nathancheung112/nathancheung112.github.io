        <p class="lead mb-4">Internal Relations Focus<br><br>

        My name is Nathan Cheung, a second-year student at the University of California, Riverside studying Political Science with a concentration in International Relations. I am currently seeking outlets that allow me to further develop my clerical skills and implement my prior knowledge in political theory to current events. I am writing to express my interest in interning with the Orange County Public Defenderâ€™s Office for the summer of 2025. 
In my previous roles, I was able to develop a well-versed understanding of all Microsoft and Google platforms and client protocol. I pride myself in my organizational skills and ability to lead which has been honed through various roles, such as serving as Director of Brotherhood for my Pre-Law and Government Fraternity. In this role, I am responsible for leading impactful initiatives to serve about 45 of my peers. Through this opportunity I was able to foster a collaborative environment for the betterment of fellow pre-law students. 
<br><br>

        After reviewing this opportunity, I am eager to learn more about this position as I am able to apply my prior experience in community outreach with UC Riversideâ€™s Chinese Student Association. As Producer of the annual Chinese Culture Night, it is a year-round role as I coordinate with local sponsors, manage all marketing campaigns regarding the event, and head a committee to ensure the eventâ€™s success. These experiences required attention to detail, time management, and adaptabilityâ€”skills I am eager to bring to the Public Defenderâ€™s Office.
Interning with the Orange County Public Defenderâ€™s Office offers a unique opportunity to contribute towards equitable legal processes. I anticipate being available Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 1:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., starting on June 26th. I am confident my leadership, organizational abilities, and passion for public service make me a strong candidate for this position. Please refer to my resume for my qualifications. Thank you for taking the time to review my application and I sincerely look forward to speaking with you about this position. I am happy to provide additional information upon request; I can be reached at my contact information above.
